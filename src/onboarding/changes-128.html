          <h1>Provider for Google Calendar</h1>
          <p>
            The Provider for Google Calendar marked the beginning of my journey into open source.
            Back in 2006, there was no easy way to connect Thunderbird with Google Calendar. Driven
            by curiosity and a desire to help, I explored Google‚Äôs APIs and found a way to bridge
            that gap, enabling countless Thunderbird users to access Google Calendar. That
            experience not only gave me a sense of purpose but also opened doors to a professional
            career where open source has become an integral part of my daily life.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Provider for Google Calendar has mostly been translated from English to German
            because those are the languages I speak. A few other strings are translated due to past
            history of being within Thunderbird's source code repository. But about 40% of strings
            have changed or been added since. Thanks to Weblate, you can now easily help with the
            cause. Do you speak a non-English language?

          <h2>Ready for something new? Try the beta version</h2>

          <p>
            Thunderbird has been embracing the "WebExtensions" technology you may also know from
            Firefox, which promises greater stability across Thunderbird updates. While there are
            some downsides to how customizable the UI is, it was an oppportunity to rewrite major
            portions of the add-on. This allowed me to fix some of the long-standing issues, for
            example related to dismissing reminders on meeting invites.

            Given the substantial changes, having many people test the beta is key.
