          <p class="warning">
            Hi beta users! This is the page that release channel users will see when they upgrade to
            the new version. It contains a migration section where calendars can be upgraded to the
            new format. Please give it a whirl and
            <a href="https://github.com/kewisch/gdata-provider/discussions/categories/beta" target="_blank">let me know how it goes</a>.
            <br><br>
            You will not see the section if you don't have legacy calendars in your list. If you
            want to try it out nevertheless you can keep this tab open, subscribe to a legacy
            calendar and then reload this page. Alternatively test the upgrade in the calendar
            properties of a legacy calendar.
            <br><br>
            Further please make sure the legacy calendars still work as expected when subscribing to
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Welcome to version 140.0.0 of the Provider for Google Calendar. A while back I asked for
            beta testers, and now the changes we tested together are making their way into the
            release version.
          </p>
          <p>
            This update introduces the new approach while still keeping the old one available. Both
            are bundled into this release so you can try the new features with confidence, and if
            something does not work as expected you can easily switch back.
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="upgradeSection">
          <h2>⚠️ Upgrade your calendars</h2>
          <p>
            To use the new features, you will need to update your calendars. For now this step is
            optional, but I strongly recommend upgrading now so that any issues can be identified
            and fixed early. The old approach will be removed in a future release.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to go back, unsubscribe from the calendar and re-subscribe using the legacy option.

          <h2>What's new?</h2>
          <p>
            Here is a selection of features and fixes in the new approach. The code has been rebuilt
            from the ground up using a new set of calendar APIs, which I plan to submit to
            Thunderbird core so that all add-on developers can benefit from them.
            <ul>
              <li>Attachments are now linked on events (read-only)</li>
              <li>You can add or remove video conference links directly from your events</li>
              <li>
                Events you are invited to that are marked as public will instead be created as
                private in your calendar, to protect your privacy.
              </li>
              <li>Birthday events are now supported, just subscribe to the birthday calendar to see them.</li>
              <li>
                A whole class of issues related to modifying events you are invited to is resolved,
                as the Provider will just update the properties you change, not attempt to replace
                the whole event.
              </li>
              <li>Dark mode looks better across dialogs, options, and setup screens.</li>
              <li>Making many quick changes, like deleting multiple events, will no longer cause rate limiting errors.</li>
              <li>Event invitations and attendees are handled more reliably.</li>
              <li>Invitations that use Windows timezone names are now supported more consistently.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            A big thank you to everyone who supported me on the way to this release. I've put in
            quite a bit of effort to get us where we are, and I couldn't have done it without you.
