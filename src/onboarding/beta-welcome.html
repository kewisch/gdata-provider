          <p>
            Welcome to the beta version of the Provider for Google Calendar. Thank you for helping
            me move across the finish line, and helping to resolve any remaining issues before they
            affect so many other people.
          </p>

          <h2>Get started: Re-subscribe to your calendars</h2>

          <p>
            The final version will have a migration step to take care of this, but for now you'll
            need to re-subscribe to all your Google Calendars. The internal calendar type identifier
            needs to be different in the new version, so your other calendars will appear as if they
            are not supported.

          <h2>Testing Plan</h2>
          <p>
            A good starting point from there is the testing plan originally written for the legacy version of
            this add-on. It roughly contains all the things you can do with this add-on. The new
            version should behave roughly the same, though there may be some tweaks on the UX. There
            are certain aspects that should actually work better, such as dismissing alarms on
            meetings.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can find the testing plan <a href="https://github.com/kewisch/gdata-provider/blob/legacy/TESTING.md">on the github repository</a>.

          <h2>Event dialog: more changes to come</h2>
          <img src="images/task-dialog.png">
          <p>
            Thunderbird doesn't have a built-in calendar API as of current. This add-on will be the
            start for changing that. Together with the add-on rewrite, I've also written a
            <a href="https://github.com/thunderbird/webext-experiments/tree/main/calendar/">calendar experiment API</a>
            that other add-on developers can make use of. It will eventually be part of Thunderbird
            itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            One downside of the Web/MailExtensions API is that it isn't quite as flexible in the
            user interface. There should only be a few defined entry points. Customizing the event
            dialog to wrap an API around it has proven to be difficult as an experiment, and should
            likely be handled in the application itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            So for now, the event dialog is still fully customized using the legacy code. There
            shouldn't be an impact to you as a user, but if you notice that the event dialog is not
            working it may be related to this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once I have mockups or implementation of the new event dialog design, I'll keep you
            updated and make sure you have a chance to test and provide feedback.
