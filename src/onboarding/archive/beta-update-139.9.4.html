            Thank you for being a beta tester for the Provider for Google Calendar!

          <h2>What's New in 139.9.4</h2>
          <p>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Don't set PUBLIC visibility on events received through invitations</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Fixes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fix a console error where conferenceSolutions was not defined</li>
              <li>Correctly serialize snoozes on recurring events</li>
              <li>Work around organizer participation status not being set correctly</li>
              <li>Don't remember older snoozes on recurring events to avoid property size limitations</li>
              <li>Better allow accepting events with Windows timezone names</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            If there are issues, the most likely would be around snoozing recurring events or not
            being able to set your participation status as an event organizer. I'm hoping though the
            experience is smoother than before, as the patches fix a few edge cases that have been
            reported.
          </p>
          <p>
            I haven't received any feedback on the edit conferencing feature from 139.9.3. No news
            is good news? Please use the release discussion if you have feedback in either
            direction.
